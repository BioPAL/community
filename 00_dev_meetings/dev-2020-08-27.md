3. Break Points Discussion
4. Other


## Updates
- [Slack channel invitations](https://join.slack.com/t/biopal-esa/shared_invite/zt-h1xnupg1-JvqO619wLkO9iYbBmcm24w) sent
- [meeting notes access](https://join.slack.com/t/biopal-esa/shared_invite/zt-h1xnupg1-JvqO619wLkO9iYbBmcm24w)
- official e-mail address: biopal@esa.int
- website: request for biopal@esa.int running
- other:
    - ground data: wish for smaller more distributed plots world wide instead of supersites 

## Governance Documents
**drafts**
- CoC draft: https://github.com/BioPAL/governance/pull/3/files
- Governance text draft: https://github.com/BioPAL/governance/pull/6

**discussion**
- Volunteers for Code of Conduct Committee?
    - Clement Albinet
    - Paolo Mazzucchelli
    - ESA Mediation service (to be checked)
- Volunteers for Steering Council Membership?
- Contributing Code/ Development:
    - Required reviews on PRs/ self merging
        - at least one review by a steering council member is required
        - self-merging is not encouraged
    - prefered dev environment setup (i.e. Docker)?
        - virtual machine on MAAP, Docker (later decision)
        - cloning recommended for now, own development environment
        - testing in building Docker

## Break Points Discussion
- Brainstorming sessions where break points would be usefull for AGB Processor
    - manage parameters, options:
        - for each call (?)
        - use of a dictionary (?)
        - classess containing parameters (?)
    - and choose saving of intermediary results
    - access point qualification
        - improvement of functions
        - input/ output driven
        - sensible 'final product', steps of flow chart
    - major processing steps, brainstorming:
        - split global forest into chunks, create blocks, to tweak block size and shape (polygones, grid, hexagon, ...)
        - ideal: avoiding blocks (gloal optimization ?)
            - possibility to global optimization
        - open possibility to change constraints in optimization/ fit, Flexibility to vary input parameters individually for each pixel
        - function to calculate parameter values at every pixel value, start wiht one value (placeholder function)

- Identify 2/3 test break points
    - change of block size and block outline
    - access to fit/ optimization functionality
    - placeholder function (modularization) that allows for calculating parameter values per pixel

- Set up installation for work with Jupyter Lab

### Proposed action Items:
- [ ] testing in building Docker (Paolo)
- [ ] idea collection of break points (Francesco ?) for next meeting
- [ ] doodle reoccuring meeting time (Stefanie)
- [x] create channels (Stefanie)

# Next Meeting: 16.09 Wednesday 9:30 -11:00
